		<h3>What causes migratory stress?</h3>

		<p>Migratory stress, also known as migratory grief or mourning, is a condition that occurs when the changes brought on by migration cannot be overcome. This includes any changes that occur before, during, and after migrating as well as any underlying medical issues or social circumstances.<br><br>*It is a distress that affects both the migrant and any loved ones left behind.</p>

		<h3>Risk factors for children of migrants </h3>

		<p>Studies show that children of migrants are more likely to develop mental disorders than their friends, including issues in behavioral conduct like problems with friends and prevalence of anxiety and depression. They are often subject to discrimination and violence and suffer from risks of abandonment and neglect. For this reason, children of migrants have an even greater prevalence of developing mental disorders than their parents abroad.</p>

		<h3>The role of family</h3>

		<p>The experience of pain constitutes a healthy part of life in adapting to new changes and parents as models for personal growth, play a great role in their own children’s emotional development. As a fundamental period, childhood is a critical time in the development of self-esteem and confidence. Because of this, the longer the separation, the more serious the consequences and the damage done can be irreversible. Parents as well as other family members need to become role models for children and adolescents in addressing their own sorrow.</p>

		<h3>Staying informed</h3>

		<p>Being informed is the best line of defense in overcoming the effects of migratory stress. For this reason, planning is instrumental in responding to the difficulties that at hand.</p>
